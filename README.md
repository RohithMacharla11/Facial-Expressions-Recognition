# Facial Expression Recognition with CNN 🎭
A deep learning project focused on detecting facial expressions and recognizing emotions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project leverages a labeled dataset of facial expressions and aims to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection by employing advanced deep learning techniques.

## 🌟 Project Overview
Facial expression recognition plays a pivotal role in applications such as:<br>

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Enhancing user experience by recognizing emotions.<br>
Surveillance Systems: Detecting suspicious behavior.<br>
Healthcare: Monitoring mental health and emotions.<br>
Marketing: Analyzing customer reactions.<br>
This project uses a CNN-based approach to classify facial expressions into distinct emotion categories, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.<br>

## 🛠️ Features
Emotion Detection: Classifies images into predefined categories of facial expressions.<br>
CNN Architecture: Uses convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.<br>
Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.<br>
Visualization: Generates graphs for accuracy vs. epoch and loss vs. epoch to monitor training performance.<br>
Custom Dataset Support: Easily adaptable for different datasets.<br>
